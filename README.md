**Be advise that this library is in the process to behing moved officially to a brand new repo** with still the same concepts but developped in a better, more modular and safe way! Even if this repo has not moved since almost a year, heavy work has been done in parallel to fit our needs & bring a lot more possibilities to other developpers to extend it!

Also, this brand (modular) was a first baby step towards it, you can still checkout the API in the main branch readme : https://github.com/gahabeen/jsonframe-cheerio/tree/master#readme.

This will **not be maintain anymore** but should still work though.

More coming soon.
